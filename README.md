## 📖 About The Project

In today's fast-paced society, many people struggle to plan healthy meals, often leading to food waste and a reliance on expensive food delivery services. Existing recipe applications are typically too general and fail to connect a user's available ingredients with their personal health goals. This project, the **Personalized Nutritional Meal Planning System**, aims to solve this problem by creating a smart web application. The system will provide tailored recipe recommendations based on a user's dietary restrictions, health objectives (like weight loss or muscle gain), and the ingredients they already have in their kitchen, empowering users to make healthier, more economical, and sustainable food choices.

## 🚀 Modules Under Development

This project is divided into the following modules, with each team member leading the development of a specific component.

*   **User Profile & Pantry Module**
    *   **Developer:** FATIN NURQASDINA BINTI RASHID
    *   **Description:** This module handles user authentication (registration and login), manages personal dietary profiles (including health goals, allergies, and food preferences), and allows users to maintain a virtual inventory of ingredients in their pantry.

*   **Personalized Recommendation Engine**
    *   **Developer:** HO RONG JIE
    *   **Description:** As the core "brain" of the system, this backend module uses a Knowledge-Based Recommender System. It processes the user's profile and pantry data to intelligently filter a recipe database, providing a ranked list of the most suitable recipes.

*   **Recipe Display Module**
    *   **Developer:** MUHAMMAD AKMAL BAIHAQI BIN KHAIRUL ANAM MAK
    *   **Description:** This frontend module fetches and displays recipe details in a user-friendly interface. It presents the ingredients, step-by-step cooking instructions, and key nutritional information like calories and protein content.

*   **Database & System Integration**
    *   **Developer:** DHESEETHRA A/P BALAKRISHNAN
    *   **Description:** This role focuses on designing and managing the project's database schema, ensuring data integrity, and integrating the frontend and backend modules so they communicate effectively.
