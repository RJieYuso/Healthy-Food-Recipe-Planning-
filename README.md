## 📖 About The Project

In today's fast-paced society, many people struggle to plan healthy meals, often leading to food waste and a reliance on expensive food delivery services. Existing recipe applications are typically too general and fail to connect a user's available ingredients with their personal health goals. This project, the **Personalized Nutritional Meal Planning System**, aims to solve this problem by creating a smart web application. The system will provide tailored recipe recommendations based on a user's dietary restrictions, health objectives (like weight loss or muscle gain), and the ingredients they already have in their kitchen, empowering users to make healthier, more economical, and sustainable food choices.
